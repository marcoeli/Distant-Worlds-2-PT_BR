Your relationship with other empires can take a number of forms, beginning with no contact, and progressing all the way through to defense treaties and operations map sharing.

You can have any number of treaties at the same time. For example, you can have a Non Aggression treaty, Free Trade agreement and Migration treaty at the same time.

However when war is declared all current treaties are cancelled.

The different treaty types are listed below:

[H3]No relationship[/H3]
This means that there is no special relationship between the two empires.
 
[H3]Non Aggression[/H3]
The empires agree not to attack each others ships or bases.

[H3]Pirate Protection[/H3]
Pirate factions may offer Pirate Protection treaties to empires. This means that the empire pays the pirates a monthly fee to avoid being attacked by them.

[H3]Trade Agreements[/H3]
The empires agree to trade resources between each other. Without a trade agreement there is no resource trading at all between the two empires.

There are 3 levels of trade agreement:
[ULI]Restricted Trade: 50% trade fees[/ULI]
[ULI]Limited Trade: 20% trade fees[/ULI]
[ULI]Free Trade: no trade fees[/ULI]

[H3]Territory Map Sharing[/H3]
The two empires regularly swap territory maps, revealing the location of their colonized systems.

[H3]Migration[/H3]
The two empires agree to accept migrants between their colonies from each other.

[H3]Exploration[/H3]
The two empires agree to allow exploration ships to operate freely within each others territory.

[H3]Mining Rights[/H3]
The two empires agree to allow the building on mining stations anywhere within each others territory.

[H3]Galaxy Map Sharing[/H3]
The two empires regularly swap galaxy maps, revealing all of their exploration data.

[H3]Military Refuelling[/H3]
The two empires agree to allow their fleets and military ships to refuel at each others bases and colonies.

[H3]Research[/H3]
The two empires agree to share a portion of their research output.

[H3]Intelligence Sharing[/H3]
The two empires agree to share intelligence data with each other.

[H3]Defense[/H3]
The two empires agree to defend each other in the event that another empire declares war on either party.

[H3]Operations Map Sharing[/H3]
The two empires agree to share the location of all their units throughout the galaxy. This provides better shared visibility of enemy units and allows better coordination.

[H3]War[/H3]
Open warfare between two empires. Expect opportunistic attacks on outlying mining stations as well as coordinated attacks on your colonies along with ground invasions.

War continues until both sides agree to end it. Empires will typically agree to end a war when they are pressed with heavy losses. Alternatively an empire’s populace may become weary of a long war and force an end to the fighting.
