Intelligence missions enable you to secretly infiltrate other empires and steal or destroy their assets.

[H3]Spies[/H3]
Spies are the highly-trained and skilled specialists that you use to accomplish these missions.

Spies become more skilled with each successful mission. The more skilled a spy is, the more difficult a mission they can take on.

Conversely, it only takes one failed mission to get your spy killed or captured, so choose your missions wisely.

[H3]Counter Intelligence[/H3]
Counter-intelligence is also critical to protect your empire. You can assign spies to prevent enemy intelligence missions – they will actively seek out spies and saboteurs and report any discoveries to you. Counter-intelligence uses the Counter Espionage skill.

[H3]Diplomatic fallout[/H3]
Beware of the negative fallout from botched intelligence missions – if another empire discovers your actions against them it will dramatically lower their estimation of your empire, and could even lead to war.
